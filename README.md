# SystemVerilog_Functional_Coverage
The stimulus you are using for the verification of design is exhaustive enough that you have covered all the necessary scenarios and situations to prove the design is working correctly? This is where functional coverage comes in. Functional coverage report tells us that whether all the required values of the signals or required FSM states has been covered by the stimulus that is being used for the verification of the design. This repository contains different projects related to the functional coverage of the designs using SystemVerilog Testbench. They are covering the fundamentals of different types of bins e.g. Implicit bins, Explicit bins, Wildcard bins, Ignore bins, default bins, illegal bins and cover group. Functional Coverage gives us the ability to verify the relation between the different signals by using Cross Coverage, therefore in these projects Cross coverage with different combination filtering strategies is also used. Transition bins are also used to verify the intended behavior of the FSMs to make sure that with applied stimulus all the states are covered atleast once.
These projects demonstrate the:
- Usage of Functional Coverage in Verification
- Implicit and explicit bins, default bins illegal bins, ignore bins, wildcard bins, covergroup, sampling events, 
- Transition bins and Cross Coverage
